  Where does Zestimate predict well?
  
  To get a quick feel where zestimate predicts well, we can group our absolute logerror into different percentiles, e.g. the percentile with best predictions (top 10%), worst predictions (worst 10%) and typical predictions (50% around the median).
  

```r
transactions <- transactions %>% mutate(percentiles=cut(abs_logerror,quantile(abs_logerror,c(0,0.1,0.25,0.75,0.9,1),names=FALSE),include.lowest = TRUE, labels=FALSE))

head(transactions)
```

 Where does Zestimate over or underpredict?
A high absolute logerror tells us predictions are not that good. But this could either be driven by underpredicting or overpredicting sale price.


```r

tmp %>% ggplot(aes(x=latitude,y=abs_logerror,fill=overunder,color=overunder))+geom_smooth(size=1.2)+theme_bw()+scale_fill_brewer(palette=col_pal)+scale_color_brewer(palette = col_pal)
